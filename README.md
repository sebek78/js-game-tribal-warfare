# The Short Notes Notebook

This is a simple card game for two players. Each player controls a primal tribe. The goal of the game is to eliminate the concurrency tribe from this valley.

This game is inspired by other card games but is not a clone or remake of any other game.

The Polish language is the content game language.

I created this project to practice coding in React and Redux technology.
